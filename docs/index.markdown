I'm David Arbour, a Senior Research Scientist at Adobe Research. My work revolves around causal inference, experimental design, off-policy evaluation, and learning on graphs. I am particularly interested these days in understanding the role of these approaches in complex scenarios and settings involving interactions between humans and large scale machine learning models.
